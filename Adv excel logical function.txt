Advanced Excel Logical Functions – Questions
===========================================
1. What is the purpose of the IF function in Excel?
------The purpose of the IF function in Excel is to perform a logical test, returning one value if the condition is true and another value if it's false.
      =IF(A1>10, "Greater than 10", "Not greater than 10")
2. How does the AND function work in Excel?
------In Excel, the AND function evaluates multiple conditions and returns TRUE only if all the conditions are true; otherwise, it returns FALSE. 
      =AND(A1>10, A2<20, A3=5)
3. What is the difference between AND and OR functions?
------In Excel, the AND function returns TRUE only if all its arguments are TRUE; otherwise, it returns FALSE. Conversely, the OR function returns TRUE if at least one of its arguments is TRUE; it returns FALSE only if all arguments are FALSE. 
      =AND(A1>10, B1<20)
      =OR(A1>10, B1<20)
4. How can you use the NOT function in Excel?
------The Excel NOT function reverses a logical value, returning TRUE if the argument is FALSE and FALSE if the argument is TRUE.
      =IF(NOT(A1>10), "Less than or equal to 10", "Greater than 10")
5. What is a Nested IF function?
------In Excel, a nested IF function means placing one or more IF statements inside another IF statement, allowing you to test multiple conditions and return different results based on those conditions. 
      =IF(A1>=90, "A", IF(A1>=80, "B", IF(A1>=70, "C", "F")))   
6. Give an example where IF and AND functions are used together.
       =IF(AND(A1>10, A2<20), "Yes", "No")
7. How does the OR function evaluate multiple conditions?
-------The OR function evaluates multiple conditions by returning TRUE if at least one of the conditions is TRUE, and FALSE only if all conditions are FALSE. 
8. What happens if an IF function condition is not met?
9. Can you use logical functions with text values?

10. How can you use logical functions to classify data into categories?
--------You can use logical functions like IF, AND, OR, and NOT to classify data into categories by setting up conditional statements that evaluate to TRUE or FALSE, then assigning a category based on the result. 

Getting Started with Conditional Formatting – Questions
=======================================================
11. What is Conditional Formatting in Excel?
--------Conditional formatting makes it easy to highlight certain values or make particular cells easy to identify
12. How can you highlight cells with values greater than 50?

13. What formula would you use to format cells containing negative numbers?
-------"Format Cells" feature and select the "Number" tab, then choose the desired format for negative numbers 
14. How do you apply a color scale in Conditional Formatting?
15. Can Conditional Formatting be applied to an entire row based on a single cell?
16. How do you highlight duplicate values using Conditional Formatting?
17. What is the use of Icon Sets in Conditional Formatting?
18. How do Data Bars help in visualizing numerical data?
19. Can Conditional Formatting be applied dynamically?
20. What happens if Conditional Formatting rules conflict with each other?

Advanced Level Validation in Excel – Questions
===============================================
21. What is Data Validation in Excel?
------In Excel, data validation is a feature that allows you to set rules for the type of data that can be entered into a cell or range of cells, ensuring accuracy and consistency. 
22. How do you restrict data entry to whole numbers only?
------Select Data >Data Validation. On the Settings tab, under Allow, select an option: Whole Number
23. What is the purpose of using a drop-down list in Data Validation?
------to restrict user input to a predefined list of options, ensuring data accuracy and consistency while simplifying data entry
24. How can you restrict data entry to a specific date range?
------use the "Data Validation" feature, selecting "Date" as the allowed data type and specifying the start and end dates for the valid range. 
25. How can you prevent duplicate entries in a column?
--------using data validation choose remove duplicate values.
26. What is a custom validation rule in Excel?
27. How do you display an error message for invalid data entry?
------Under data validation ,Input message and error alert we can set the Alert messages.
28. Can you use Data Validation with formulas?
29. What is the difference between List Validation and Custom Validation?
30. How can Data Validation improve data integrity in an Excel sheet?
